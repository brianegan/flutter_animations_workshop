# Convert into a Stateful Widget

As mentioned before, implicit animations work automatically when you change a
property value on your widget. You do it by using
a [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
and a `setState()` method.

In your example, you have a `MyApp` widget that extends `StatelessWidget` 
(look at line #7). To convert it into a `StatefulWidget`, you need to:
1. Change a subclass from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
2. Override `createState()` method, which  will return a new instance of 
   `_MyAppState` class.
3. Create `_MyAppState` class that extends from `State<MyApp>`
4. Move the `build()` method which was previously in the `MyApp` class to 
   `_MyAppState`.

When you run the app now, you shouldn't see any difference. But your 
widget is now prepared for changing a state!
