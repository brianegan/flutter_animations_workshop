# Summary

This was the last step. If you followed this workshop, you should have an app 
that implements basic animations for changing size, position, opacity and 
rotating widgets.

But... it's not the end! In this workshop we used just a few widgets from the 
big list of all `ImplicitlyAnimatedWidgets`. Using the code from this 
tutorial, you can try other widgets. 

For animating changes in widget's position:
- [AnimatedPadding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPadding-class.html)
- [AnimatedSlide](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSlide-class.html)
- [AnimatedPositioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPositioned-class.html)

For animating transitions between two widgets:
- [AnimatedSwitcher](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSwitcher-class.html)
- [AnimatedCrossFade](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedCrossFade-class.html)

For animating changes in widget's size:
- [AnimatedSize](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSize-class.html)
- [AnimatedScale](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedScale-class.html)

For animating text changes:
- [AnimatedDefaultTextStyle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedDefaultTextStyle-class.html)
