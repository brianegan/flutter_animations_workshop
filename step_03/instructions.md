# Animate look using AnimatedContainer

Now is the time to finally create some animations!

As the widget already changes its state, all that is left is to replace 
`Container` with an `AnimatedContainer` and add a `Duration` of the 
animation (line #30)

```dart

child: AnimatedContainer(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  width: _width,
  height: _height,
  color: _color,
),

```

And voil√†! Now, when you run the app and tap on the button, the rectangle's 
size and color should change with a smooth animation.
